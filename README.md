## 1. Count your words - Twitter like textarea with charactercount

If you have ever used twitter, you must know your tweet will have a character count limit of 280 characters and once you cross that character limit twitter starts marking your characters with red background and you will see a character count going in a negative value! That's it, that is the task. You can build the same textarea with a customised character count limit.

Features to include in it -

1. Create a simple textarea and add neceessary styling.
2. There should be a customisable character count limit to your textarea.
3. Show this limit below the textarea. _Improvement - You can add progress circle showing the count._
4. If characcters goees beyond the limit, highlight them, decrease the count to negative value and disable the submit button.
5. You can also add warnings when only 10% character limit is remaining.
6. If a user is adding symbols such as `@` or `#` made them as a link with relevant href.
